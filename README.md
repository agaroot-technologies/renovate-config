This is a Renovate config commonly inherited by AGAROOT products.

Use this setting to keep up with updates to the library and maintain high code quality.

## üëè Getting Started

### 1. Install Renovate App

Install the [Renovate App](https://github.com/apps/renovate) in the repository.

### 2. Allow auto merge

Allow [automatic merging](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request) of repositories to make Renovate auto-merge work.

Updates below the minor version will be merged automatically, so be sure to use [branch protection rules](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) accordingly.

### 3. Install Auto Approve Bot

Install the [Approve App](https://github.com/apps/renovate-approve) that automatically approves pull requests in the repository.

If merging a pull request requires the approval of two people, install an additional [Approve2 App](https://github.com/apps/renovate-approve-2) in the repository.

### 4. Configure Renovate

Create a Renovate configuration file (`renovate.json`), and add `github>agaroot-technologies/renovate-config` to the extends property.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "extends": [
    "github>agaroot-technologies/renovate-config"
  ]
}
```

If additional settings are required, modify the configuration accordingly.

Check the [Renovate documentation](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/) for configuration details.
